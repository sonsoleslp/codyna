\title{Calculate Dynamic Complexity Measures for Time-Series Data}
\usage{
complexity(data, measures = "complexity", window = 7L, align = "center")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{[\code{ts}, \code{numeric()}]\cr
Univariate time series data.}

\item{measures}{[\code{character()}]\cr
A vector of measures to calculate. See 'Details' for more information
on the available measures.}

\item{window}{[\code{integer(1)}: \code{7L}]\cr
A positive \code{integer} specifying the rolling window size.
Must be at least \code{2}.}

\item{align}{[\code{character(1)}: \code{"center"}]\cr
Alignment of the window. The available options are: \code{"center"}, \code{"right"},
and \code{"left"}. The calculated measure is assigned to the center, rightmost,
or leftmost point of the window, respectively.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with the time index, the original time-series data,
and the calculated measures.
}
\description{
Computes dynamic complexity and other rolling window measures for univariate
time series data.
}
\details{
The following measures can be calculated:
\itemize{
\item \code{"complexity"}: Product of fluctuation and distribution measures.
\item \code{"fluctuation"}: Root mean square of successive differences.
\item \code{"distribution"}: Deviation from uniform distribution.
\item \code{"autocorrelation"}: Lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient.
\item \code{"max"}: Rolling maximum.
\item \code{"min"}: Rolling minimum.
\item \code{"variance"}: Rolling variance.
}

The option \code{"all"} computes all of the above.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
ts_data <- stats::arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 1, 0), ar = 0.6), n = 200)

# Single measure
comp_single <- complexity(ts_data, measures = "complexity")

# Multiple measures
comp_multi <- complexity(ts_data, measures = c("complexity", "variance"))
