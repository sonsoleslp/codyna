\title{Regime Detection for Time Series Data}
\usage{
detect_regimes(
  data,
  method = "smart",
  sensitivity = "medium",
  min_change,
  window = 10,
  consolidate = FALSE,
  similarity = 0.6,
  peak = 2,
  cumulative = 0.6
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{[\code{ts}, \code{numeric()}]\cr Univariate time series data.}

\item{method}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr Detection method.
The available options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cumulative_peaks"}: Detects cumulative complexity peaks using Z-tests.
\item \code{"changepoint"}: Change point detection (multi-window mean-shift test).
\item \code{"threshold"}: Adaptive quartile-based regime classification.
\item \code{"variance_shift"}: Detects changes in variance patterns.
\item \code{"slope"}: Detects changes in local slope (rolling linear models).
\item \code{"entropy"}: Detects changes in the Shannon entropy of the
complexity series, calculated in rolling windows.
\item \code{"smart"} (default): Combines gradient, peaks, and changepoint methods.
\item \code{"all"}: Applies all individual methods listed above and uses
ensemble voting.
}}

\item{sensitivity}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr Detection sensitivity level.
The available options are: \code{"low"}, \code{"medium"}, \code{"high"}.
The default is \code{"medium"}. This affects thresholds and window sizes within
the detection methods.}

\item{min_change}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr Minimum number of observations between
changes. If missing (default), the value is determined automatically
(typically 10\% of observations, minimum of 10).}

\item{window}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr base window size for rolling calculations.
This is further adjusted by \code{sensitivity}. The default is \code{10}.}

\item{consolidate}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr Should regimes that are statistically
similar after initial detection be merged? The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{similarity}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr A value between 0 and 1 that defines
the threshold for considering regimes similar enough to merge if
\code{consolidate = TRUE}. Based on normalized mean difference.
The default is \code{0.6}.}

\item{peak}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr Base z-score threshold for individual peak
detection with the \code{"cumulative_peaks"} method.
Adjusted by \code{sensitivity}. The default is \code{2.0}.}

\item{cumulative}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr A value between 0 and 1 that defines
the base proportion threshold for identifying cumulative peak regions.
Adjusted by \code{sensitivity}. The default is \code{0.6}.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} containing the original time series data
and additional columns with regime information:

\code{change}: Logical indicating regime change points
\code{id}: An \code{integer} regime identifier
\code{stability}: Categorical stability: "Stable", "Transitional", "Unstable"
\code{complexity_pattern}: Pattern description:
"Increasing", "Decreasing", "Stable", "Fluctuating"
\code{stability_score}: Numeric stability score (0-1)
\code{type}: Type of change detected by the method
\code{magnitude}: Magnitude of the change (method-specific interpretation)
\code{confidence}: Confidence in the detection
(method-specific interpretation, typically 0-1)
}
\description{
Detects regime changes in time series data using multiple methods including
cumulative peaks, changepoint detection, variance shifts,
threshold analysis, gradient changes, and entropy analysis.
